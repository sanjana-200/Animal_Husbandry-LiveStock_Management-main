# Animal_Husbandry-LiveStock_Management

This project is a comprehensive web application designed to assist in various aspects of animal husbandry and livestock management. It provides tools for rearing guidance, AI-powered assistance, disease detection, and access to relevant information and services.

## Features

* **Animal Rearing Guidance:** Get personalized data on space, feed, cost, water, hygiene, and seasonal tips for different types and numbers of livestock (Cow, Buffalo, Pig, Goat, Sheep, Poultry, Bee Hiving, Sericulture).
* **AI Chatbot:** An interactive chatbot powered by Groq API and Google Translator that can answer questions related to animal husbandry and livestock practices in multiple languages.
* **Disease Detection:** Upload an image of an animal to detect potential diseases using a pre-trained Keras model and receive medication/management suggestions.
* **Government Schemes:** Find information on government schemes and financial aids related to animal husbandry.
* **Veterinary Map:** Locate nearby veterinary hospitals using Google Maps (requires a Google Maps API key).

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Python (Flask Framework)
* **Machine Learning:** Keras (for disease detection model), NumPy, Pillow (PIL)
* **AI/NLP:** Groq API (for chatbot), Deep Translator (for language translation)
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (for some pages)
* **Deployment:** Render (recommended for free tier deployment)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
